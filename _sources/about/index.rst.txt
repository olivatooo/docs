Thus, it is very important to us to involve everybody in our project: Developers, modders, game mode creators and players. We want to provide you many opportunities to express yourself, not only to gain recognition but also to profit financially from your own work. Your power and the power of the community is what we aim to make useful to create the best multiplayer experience, together. Furthermore, this shall be reflected in our pricing policy. We are going to participate on the income people earn with nanos world to ensure a fair and equitable pricing policy and we are not going to charge players a lot of money!
